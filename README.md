2D/3D Game Engine

This is a simple 3D Game Engine to render shapes in a 3D perspective using WASD to move the camera around and the mouse for camera rotations.
Planning to make this engine primitive to learn the basics of graphics.

Trying to add a way to drag and drop assets into the engine and have it let the person drag and drop them anywhere in the world.
